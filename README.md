# ruby\_patterns

Chapter examples from Head First Design Patterns, implemented with Ruby instead
of Java.

I haven't read Design Patterns in Ruby yet, so I'll probably have these all
wrong.  But I'll go back and revise after I've read it!  It will be a learning
experience for me to compare how the two different languages solve the same
problems.
